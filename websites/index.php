		<h1>Website Projects</h1>

		<p>All the websites I build are responsive, semantic and standards-compliant. Technical and on-page SEO is built in from the start. I routinely use modern styling techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid.</p>

		<p>Best practices to optimize speed, security and accessibility are a matter of course. I always include scheduled backups on WordPress sites and configure several 'hardening' settings.</p>

		<p>I also routinely setup Google Analytics and Console on websites I build and provide a Data Studio report I've created.</p>

				<h4>Custom, strategically planned WordPress site for a non-profit</h4>
				<p>Compass 82 needed a high-impact website to provide its disaster-recovery information and  services, and to help with fund-raising.</p> 

				<p>Working with long-time colleague and project manager, Rita Berger, we ran a well-organized discovery process, followed by a creative design process with award-winning designer <a href="https://maryliztippinmoody.com/" target="_blank">Mary Liz Tippin Moody</a>.</p>

				<p>I wrote a custom WordPress theme based on Mary Liz's Photoshop files. Blog pages were broken up by topics, and Integrations include Events and Donation functionality. I also provided DNS configuration for external emails.</p>

				<p>I developed a site architecture that was two-tiered to provide for a multitude of target audiences. Some information is unique to the audience and some in common with all. The well-researched, scaled maps by MLTM are a highly-complimented feature.</p>

Currently, a local artist and print designer, Majken Peterzen, manages the design and content.</p>
